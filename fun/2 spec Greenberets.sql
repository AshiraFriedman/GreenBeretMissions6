For computed columns:
 -Create a computed column called 'StatusOfMission' using medal column where bronze=3,silver=2 and gold=1. 
 It Doesn't need to show but 3 means 'mission failed or incomplete'
 , 2 means 'mission in progress and 1 means 'mission complete'.
 -Create a column called 'NumMissionImportance' where from ImportanceOfMission between 5 and 10=3, between 10 and 20=2, and between 20 and 37=1. 
 3 means 'priority', 2 means 'top priority', and 1 means 'immediate action'.
 -Create a computed column called 'DogTag'. Should be: lastname, firstname, first 3 digits of YearSoldierBorn, - ,
  fourth digit of YearSoldierBorn, first digit of YarBorough, - , last three digits of YarBorough, then one 0, then words 'Blood Type', 
  then the  words 'Green Beret'. Should read like this: Masson Paul 123-45-6780 Blood Type Green Beret.
